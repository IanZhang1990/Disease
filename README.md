Disease
=========

This is a game that simulates virus spreading among people in a city or cities. It is written in Python with PyGame. I wish the game can help people understand how virus can spread and be controlled.

The initial thought will be to visualize some people in a city and one of them get sick, the virus spread among the population. The program will show how every man moves in the city, and how the virus infects different people. With the help of doctors and hospitals, the disease can be controlled. We can use the game to understand how the virus can be totally controlled, that is not coursing too many people dying and be diminished gradually.

Mat Buckland's Programming Game AI by Example( Publication Date: September 30, 2004 | ISBN-10: 1556220782 | ISBN-13: 978-1556220784 | Edition: 1 ) will be very helpful to understand the steering behavior and finite state machines.
