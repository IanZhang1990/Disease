Disease
=========

<b>I should finish my graduation required paper first before coming back to work on the project. That will be no earlier than May 20th. I found nobody stared or watches this project, so in theory ther won't be any people be disappointed. Haha....</b>

This is a game that simulates virus spreading among people in a city or cities. It is written in Python with Pygame. I wish the game can help people understand how virus can spread and be controlled.

The initial thought will be to visualize some people in a city and one of them get sick, the virus spread among the population. The program will show how every man moves in the city, and how the virus infects different people. With the help of doctors and hospitals, the disease can be controlled. We can use the game to understand how the virus can be totally controlled, that is not coursing too many people dying and be diminished gradually.

Mat Buckland's <b>Programming Game AI by Example</b>( Publication Date: September 30, 2004 | ISBN-10: 1556220782 | ISBN-13: 978-1556220784 | Edition: 1 ) will be very helpful to understand the steering behavior and finite state machines. You can find the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Game-Example-Mat-Buckland/dp/1556220782/">HERE</a>

The UML diagram can be found in <a href="https://github.com/IanZhang1990/Disease/tree/master/DiseaseGame/UML">HERE</a>. You may need Umlet, which can be downloaded <a href="www.umlet.com">HERE</a>, to open the .uxf file.

As is implied, the project is written in <b><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a></b>, so you may need to install <b><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python 2.7.4</a></b> first. And I also included Pygame package, which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">HERE</a>, and installed easily. Btw, there is a nice tutorial of Pygame <a href="">HERE</a>.

Wish you like it.
